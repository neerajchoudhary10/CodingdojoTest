The program consists 5 test cases:

1) All years divisible by 400 are leap years. Example - 2000 is leap year
2) All years divisible by 100 but not by 400 are not leap years. Example 1900 is not leap year
3) All years divisible by 4 but not by 100 are leap years. Example 2012 is leap year
4) All years not divisible by 4 are not leap years. Example 2017 is not leap year.
5) To make the Gregorian Calendar accurate program eliminates years divisible by 4000 as leap years.

Make sure you have JUnit5.0 or above in your class path to run the test cases.
